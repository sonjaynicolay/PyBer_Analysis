# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview


We were given the opportunity to review data and learn from V. isulize and the thriving PyBer. PyBer is a ridesharing business in which drivers pick up and drop off riders at their destinations. The goal is to submit a summary of how data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

##Summary


At quick glance it looks as if the most money made would be the Urban market based on rides and total fares, however when you look deeper and see that there are a lot of drivers and that the average fare per driver is a bargain for riders there is concern about the ROI for PyBer. The Suburban market falls right in the middle. The avarage fares are higher than the Urban market which maeks sense, as rides will tend to be longer than a inner city car ride. At 8,570,PyBer drivers are significantly lower than the 59,602 in the Urban market. Pointing out that more consumers in the Suburban market probably own vehicles or use other modes of transportation that would not cost the daily cost of a PyBer ride. The rural market has a high average fare per ride based on the distance driven to reach the desired destination. There weren't many rides at 125 but for rural areas, there is a good amount of drivers at 537.

##Results


My first suggestion, is for PyBer to push seasonal promotions to each city type to encourage rideshare, food delivery (both grocery and mealtime options), as appropriate. Example, during fall and harvest fests, promote rides to rural areas for pumpkin patches and corn mazes for a family experience and to promote social distancing away from more populated areas. In return, promote grocery and food delivery services to those who live in rural areas in the "crisp autumn weather." Food delivery promotions can be football and Thanksgiving based.


The next suggestion is to find ways to increase rides amongst the Suburban city market. They have a solid average ride fare. Even going as far to possibly decreasing fares for a period of time and closely tracking whether there is an increase in rides particularly in commuters and evebt attenders. Due to restrictions still in place, Event attender numbers will be quite low but it still will be a good tracking point. Those who were riding packed trains, buses and other means of transportation may be willing to:
1. Pay a little bit more during this time, to ensure a safe commute,
2. Possibly purchase a package of commuter rides, or a special commuter PyBer program.

My last suggestion is to do more research and really get down to the demographics of these markets and who is spending money with PyBer. Truly get down to who PyBer's customer is, and market directly to those people. Often times businesses spend so much time trying to expand and reach a broader market, that they completely miss the mark or move away from their main audience. Further analysis on the consumer's within those markets would really help, with promotions and where to place advertisements so that you know your advertising money is being well spent.
